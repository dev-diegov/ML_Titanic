# Titanic Survival Prediction with Machine Learning

## Introduction

This project is a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers on the Titanic. It utilizes a dataset containing information about the passengers, such as their age, gender, class, and other factors, to train and test the model's accuracy.

The project is implemented in Python and utilizes popular machine learning libraries such as NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. The primary goal is to showcase the entire machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

## Getting Started

To run this project, you can access it via Google Colab in Google Drive. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Open the project's Google Colab notebook by clicking on the following link: [ML_Titanic Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dev-diegov/ML_Titanic/blob/main/ML_Titanic.ipynb).

2. Make sure you're logged in with your Google account, and then click the "Open in Colab" button.

3. The Colab notebook contains all the code, explanations, and step-by-step instructions to run the machine learning model. You can execute the code cells in the Colab environment to see the results and interact with the project.

## Dataset

The project uses the classic Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as:

- Passenger Class (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard
- Number of Parents/Children Aboard
- Ticket Number
- Fare
- Cabin
- Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)

## Usage

Follow the instructions provided in the [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dev-diegov/ML_Titanic/blob/main/ML_Titanic.ipynb) to run the machine learning model. The notebook explains each step in detail and includes code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results

The project evaluates the model's accuracy in predicting passenger survival on the Titanic. The notebook includes visualizations and performance metrics to assess the model's performance.
